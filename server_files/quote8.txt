"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to 
the death your right to say it. Think for yourselves 
and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too. The 
most important decision you make is to be in a good 
mood. Let us read, and let us dance; these two 
amusements will never do any harm to the world."
- Voltaire
