"The only limit to our realization of tomorrow
will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward
with strong and active faith, trusting in our 
collective potential and recognizing that our
ability to shape the future is boundless. We must
confront challenges with resilience and determination,
for it is through adversity that we find our true
strength."
- Franklin D. Roosevelt, Inaugural Address, 1933.
