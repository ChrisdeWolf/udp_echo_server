"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap 
for mankind. We come in peace for all mankind,
a declaration that transcends boundaries and unites 
us as a global community. The monumental achievement 
of landing on the moon is a testament to the 
incredible progress of humanity in just a brief
period of time, reminding us of the vast possibilities 
that lie ahead." 
- Neil Armstrong, Apollo 11 Moon Landing, 1969.
