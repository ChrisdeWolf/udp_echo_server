"The only limit to our realization of tomorrow
will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward
with strong and active faith, trusting in our 
collective potential and recognizing that our
ability to shape the future is boundless. We must
confront challenges with resilience and determination,
for it is through adversity that we find our true
strength."
- Franklin D. Roosevelt, Inaugural Address, 1933.
"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap 
for mankind. We come in peace for all mankind,
a declaration that transcends boundaries and unites 
us as a global community. The monumental achievement 
of landing on the moon is a testament to the 
incredible progress of humanity in just a brief
period of time, reminding us of the vast possibilities 
that lie ahead." 
- Neil Armstrong, Apollo 11 Moon Landing, 1969.
"In this world, there are only two tragedies. 
One is not getting what one wants, and the other 
is getting it. We often desire things that may
not bring us the happiness we expect, and we must 
learn to navigate the complexities of human 
desires and outcomes. The pursuit of our desires 
can lead to unexpected consequences, and it is our 
responsibility to reflect on our aspirations and 
their impact on our lives and the lives of others." 
- Oscar Wilde.
"Our greatest glory is not in never falling, 
but in rising every time we fall. Resilience 
and the ability to learn from adversity are
sources of true strength. This philosophy, 
attributed to Confucius, has had a profound 
and lasting impact on Chinese culture and the 
way people approach challenges and setbacks 
in their lives." 
- Confucius, Chinese Philosopher (551-479 BC).
"Four score and seven years ago our fathers 
brought forth on this continent, a new nation,
conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the 
proposition that all men are created equal. 
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, 
testing whether that nation or any nation so 
conceived and so dedicated, can long endure."
- Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address, 1863
"We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight 
on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the 
fields and in the streets, we shall fight in
the hills; we shall never surrender, and if, 
which I do not for a moment believe, this island 
or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, 
then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded 
by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, 
until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all
its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and 
the liberation of the old."
- Winston Churchill, 1940
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, 
it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, 
it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, 
it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, 
it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, 
we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, 
we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going 
direct the other way – in short, the period was so far 
like the present period, that some of its noisiest 
authorities insisted on its being received, for good or
for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only."
- Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities
"To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 
'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and 
arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against 
a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die: 
to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The 
heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh 
is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd."
- William Shakespeare, Hamlet
"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to 
the death your right to say it. Think for yourselves 
and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too. The 
most important decision you make is to be in a good 
mood. Let us read, and let us dance; these two 
amusements will never do any harm to the world."
- Voltaire
"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For 
knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces 
the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth 
to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor 
in scientific research. Imagination is everything. 
It is the preview of life's coming attractions. 
Imagination is more important than knowledge. Never 
give up on what you really want to do. The person 
with big dreams is more powerful than one with all 
the facts."
- Albert Einstein
