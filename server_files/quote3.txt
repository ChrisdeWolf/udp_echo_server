"Our greatest glory is not in never falling, 
but in rising every time we fall. Resilience 
and the ability to learn from adversity are
sources of true strength. This philosophy, 
attributed to Confucius, has had a profound 
and lasting impact on Chinese culture and the 
way people approach challenges and setbacks 
in their lives." 
- Confucius, Chinese Philosopher (551-479 BC).
