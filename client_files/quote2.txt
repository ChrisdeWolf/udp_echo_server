"In this world, there are only two tragedies. 
One is not getting what one wants, and the other 
is getting it. We often desire things that may
not bring us the happiness we expect, and we must 
learn to navigate the complexities of human 
desires and outcomes. The pursuit of our desires 
can lead to unexpected consequences, and it is our 
responsibility to reflect on our aspirations and 
their impact on our lives and the lives of others." 
- Oscar Wilde.
