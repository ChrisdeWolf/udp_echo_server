"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For 
knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces 
the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth 
to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor 
in scientific research. Imagination is everything. 
It is the preview of life's coming attractions. 
Imagination is more important than knowledge. Never 
give up on what you really want to do. The person 
with big dreams is more powerful than one with all 
the facts."
- Albert Einstein
